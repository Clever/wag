# TryMutex

TryMutex is another synchronization primitive that additionaly to standard Lock and Unlock 
provides TryLock and TryLockTimeout methods.

  1. TryLock - tries to acquire lock returning true on success or false if failed.
  2. TryLockTimeout - tries to acquire a lock during specified time interval return false if time is out.

# NamedMutex

Named mutex is a syncroniation primitive that acquires lock based on name.
Primary usecase for myself is a lazy instantiation of objects based on name
that may take significant amount of time.


The following set of methods is available:
  
  1. Lock(name) - acquire lock by name.
  2. Unlock(name) - release lock by name.
  3. TryLock(name) - return true if lock acquired, otherwise false.
  4. TryLockTimeout(name, timeout) - tries to acquire lock for a certain amount of time. Returns false if timeouts.
  
# Semaphore

Semaphore is a standard semaphore implementation that uses channel as a synchronization point.

The following set of methods is available:

1. Acquire - acquire lock.
2. Release - releases lock.
3. TryAcquire - tries to acqure lock returning true/false in case of success of failure respectively.
4. TryAcqureTimeout - the same as TryAcquire, however, timeout can be provided.
5. Value - return number of currently holding semaphores.


# OnceMutex

Mutex that can be acquired only once. Successful lock will return true. All concurrent locks will block and return false when mutex is unlocked.

# NamedOnceMutex

A named set of OnceMutex. Can be used to update local cache of data identified by some key to avoid many concurrent request for the same data if data is not in the cache yet.

# ControlWaitGroup

A controlled goroutine executor that can limit the number concurrently running goroutines. Can help to solve a resource exhaustion problem.
