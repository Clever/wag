v7.1.2
- v7.1.2: Support TS methods with a single hyphenated header variable
- v7.1.1: Add close() to TypeScript clients to release outstanding handles
- v7.1.0: Properly generate TypeScript types for allOf
- v7.0.1 bugfix --client-only not generating tracing files
- v7.0.0

v7 removes all references to OpenTracing and begins adding OpenTelemetry to replace it. For now,
OpenTelemetry parts should be considered *unstable*, especially as the OpenTelemetry Go SDKs are
themselves unstable.

Support for the glide package manager for Go is also removed. Previously, wag could update your
Glide dependencies to set up the packages used by the wag generated code. Now, you should follow the
example go.mod file under samples/.
