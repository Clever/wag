# wag
sWAGger - Web API Generator

## Usage
### Generating Code
Create a swagger.yml file with your [service definition](http://editor.swagger.io/#/). Note that WAG supports a [subset](https://github.com/Clever/wag#swagger-spec) of the Swagger spec.
Copy the latest `swagger.mk` from the [dev-handbook](https://github.com/Clever/dev-handbook/blob/master/make/swagger.mk).
Set up a `generate` target in your `Makefile` that will generate server and client code:

```
include swagger.mk

SWAGGER_CONFIG := swagger.yml
SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_NAME := @clever/<servicename>
SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_VERSION := 0.1.0
SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_MODULE_NAME := <servicename>

validate: swagger-validate-deps
	$(call swagger-validate,$(SWAGGER_CONFIG))

generate: validate swagger-generate-go-deps swagger-generate-javascript-client-deps
	$(call swagger-generate-go,$(SWAGGER_CONFIG),$(PKG),$(PKG)/generated)
	$(call swagger-generate-javascript-client,$(SWAGGER_CONFIG),$(SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_NAME),$(SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_VERSION),$(SWAGGER_CLIENT_NPM_PACKAGE_MODULE_NAME))
```

Then generate your code:
```
make generate
```

This generates four directories. You should not have to modify any of the generated code:
- generated/models: contains all the definitions in your Swagger file as well as API input / output definitions
- generated/server: contains the router, middleware, and handler logic
- generated/client: contains the Go client library
- gen-js: contains the javascript client library

### Using the Go Server
To use the generated code you need to do two things:
- Implement the controller interface defined in `generated/server/interface.go`
- Pass the controller into the Server constructor. For example:
```
  s := server.New(myController, ":8000")
  // Serve should not return
  log.Fatal(s.Serve())
```

See https://github.com/Clever/wag/blob/master/impl/main.go for a working example.

### Using the Go Client
Initialize the client with `New`
```
c := client.New("https://url_of_your_service:port")
```

Make an API call
```
books, err := c.GetBooks(ctx, GetBookByIDInput{Authors: []string{"Twain"}})
if err != nil {
  // Do something with the error
}
```

If you're using the client from another WAG-ified service you should pass in the `ctx` object you get in your server handler. Otherwise you can use `context.Background()`

### Using the Javascript Client from a Node + Express server

The Javascript client is generated by a fork of [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/clever/swagger-codegen) that adds support for tracing and retries.
It has currently only been tested in Node + Express servers.

The first step is initializing the object named `ApiClient`, and setting the URL of where its located:

```javascript
import * as yourservice from 'yourservice-js';

const apiClient = new yourservice.ApiClient();
apiClient.basePath = "https://url_of_your_service:port";
```

In a request handler, you can use the `apiClient` object as an argument to construct and call specific APIs.
These specific API objects will be named after the first `tag` you give the operation in your swagger spec.

For example, if you have an operation tagged `Infra` with an `operationId` of `healthCheck`, you would call it like this:

```javascript
app.get('/some_route', (req, res) => {
  const infraAPI = new yourservice.InfraApi(apiClient, {req}); // you must pass the request context through to the client call
  infraAPI.healthCheck().then(function(data) {
    res.send('service called successfully!');
  }, function(error) {
    console.error(error);
  });
});
```

Additionally, for the above to work you will need to set up server middleware to place tracing-related metadata on the `req` object.
We currently are testing out LightStep, a service that collects tracing data and displays it in a nice UI:

```javascript
import * as express from 'express';
import * as Tracer from 'opentracing';
import * as LightStep from 'lightstep-tracer';
Tracer.initGlobalTracer(LightStep.tracer({
  access_token   : process.env.LIGHTSTEP_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  component_name : 'repo-name',
}));

const app = express();

// Middleware to look for a span from inbound requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const wireCtx = Tracer.extract(Tracer.FORMAT_HTTP_HEADERS, req.headers);
  req.span = Tracer.startSpan(req.url, { childOf : wireCtx });
  req.span.logEvent("request_received");

  // include trace ID in headers so that we can debug slow requests we see in
  // the browser by looking up the trace ID found in response headers
  let responseHeaders = {};
  Tracer.inject(req.span, Tracer.FORMAT_TEXT_MAP, responseHeaders);
  for (let key in responseHeaders) {
      if (responseHeaders.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        res.setHeader(key, responseHeaders[key])
      }
  }

  // finalize the span when the response is completed
  res.on("finish", () => {
    req.span.logEvent("request_finished");
    req.span.finish();
  });

  next()
});
```

## Tests
```
make test
```

## Future Features

These are the features we're planning on building in the near future:
- Better logging, monitoring, and metrics
  - Logger from the Context
  - Expose pprof port by default
  - Automatically log process metrics (https://github.com/Clever/go-process-metrics)
- More server middleware
  - Panic recovery / handling (don't crash the server every time you get a panic)
- More client resiliency best practices
  - Smarter retry logic
  - Timeouts


## Swagger Spec

Currently, WAG doesn't implement the entire Swagger Spec. A couple things to keep in mind:
- All schemas should reference type definitions in /definitions. Any schemas defined in /paths will cause an error.
- All parameters and definitions should be defined in their specific path object instead of globally.
- Scheme, produces, and consumers can only be defined in the top-level swagger object, not individual operations. On the top level object the scheme must be 'http', produces must be 'application/json' and consumes must be 'application/json'

Below is a more comprehensive list of the features that aren't currently supported.

### Unsupported Features
Mime Types

Multi-File Swagger Definitions

Schema:
- host
- tags
- scheme (must be http)
- consumes
- produces
- securityDefinitions
- security

Consumes:
- produces (must be application/json)
- consumes (must be application/json)
- schemes
- security

Form parameter type
Parameter:
- file parameter type
- collectionFormat
- global definitions
- possibly the json schema requirements? (uniqueItems, multipleOf, etc...)

Schema object (all these have to be defined in /definitions and are generated by go-swagger)

Discriminators

XML Modeling

Security Objects

Response:
  - Headers
