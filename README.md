# wag
sWAGger - Web API Generator

## Usage
### Generating Code
Create a swagger.yml file with your [service definition](http://editor.swagger.io/#/). Note that WAG supports a [subset](https://github.com/Clever/wag#swagger-spec) of the Swagger spec. Then generate your code:
```
make swagger
```

This generates three directories. You should not have to modify any of the generated code:
- generated/models: contains all the definitions in your Swagger file as well as API input / output definitions
- generated/server: contains the router, middleware, and handler logic
- generated/clients: contains the Go client library

### Using the Go Server
To use the generated code you need to do two things:
- Implement the controller interface defined in `generated/server/interface.go`
- Pass the controller into the Server constructure. For example:
```
  s := server.New(controller, 8080)
  log.Fatal(s.Serve())
```

See https://github.com/Clever/wag/blob/master/impl/main.go for a working example.

### Using the Go Client
Initialize the client with `New`
```
c := client.New("localhost:8000")
```

Make an API call
```
output, err := c.GetBookByID(ctx, GetBookByIDInput{ID: 1234})
if err != nil {
  // Do something with the error
}
book, ok := output.(models.GetBookByID200Output)
if !ok {
  // The only success value this returns is a 200, so anything else would be an expected error 
}
```

If you're using the client from another WAG-ified service you should pass in the `ctx` object you get in your server handler. Otherwise you can use `context.Background()`

### Using the Node Client
TODO


## Tests
```
make test
```

## Future Features

These are the features we're planning on building in the near future:
- Stricter input validation
  - Support for the required field in the Swagger spec
  - At least some of the validation defined in http://swagger.io/specification/#parameterIn. In particular we want to be able to support checking whether an input parameter is a valid object ID.
- More robust server defaults
  - SIGTERM handling
- Better logging, monitoring, and metrics
  - Logger from the Context
  - Expose pprof port by default
  - Automatically log process metrics (https://github.com/Clever/go-process-metrics)
- More server middleware
  - Panic recovery / handling (don't crash the server every time you get a panic)
- More client resiliency best practices
  - Smarter retry logic
  - Timeouts


## Swagger Spec

Currently, WAG doesn't implement the entire Swagger Spec. A couple things to keep in mind:
- All schemas should reference type definitions in /definitions. Any schemas defined in /paths will cause an error.
- All parameters and definitions should be defined in their specific path object instead of globally.
- Scheme, produces, and consumers can only be defined in the top-level swagger object, not individual operations. On the top level object the scheme must be 'http', produces must be 'application/json' and consumes must be 'application/json'

Below is a more comprehensive list of the features that aren't currently supported.

### Unsupported Features
Mime Types

Multi-File Swagger Definitions

Schema:
- host
- tags
- scheme (must be http)
- consumes
- produces
- securityDefinitions
- security

Consumes:
- produces (must be application/json)
- consumes (must be application/json)
- schemes
- security

Form parameter type
Parameter:
- file parameter type
- collectionFormat
- global definitions
- possibly the json schema requirements? (uniqueItems, multipleOf, etc...)

Schema object (all these have to be defined in /definitions and are generated by go-swagger)

Discriminators

XML Modeling

Security Objects

Response:
  - Headers
