Swagger test

# Running
```
go run main.go genclients.go
cp hardcoded/main.go generated/
cp hardcoded/middleware.go generated/
cd generated
go run main.go middleware.go router.go handlers.go contexts.go controller.go outputs.go
```

## After Generating

### Main
Two files in the generated directory are hard-coded and independent of your .yml file
- hardcoded/main.go
- hardcoded/middleware.go

The rest are built based on your swagger yml file definition.

### Files to Change
After autogenerating the code you should modify two files:
# TODO Don't copy over the controller file if it already exists
- In controller.go implement the logic of your handlers.
- In middleware.go add any middleware specific to your service


## Swagger Spec

Currently, this repo doesn't implement the entire Swagger Spec. This is a non-exhaustive list of the parts of the Swagger specification that haven't been implemented yet.

- tags
- scheme (just http)

- security

Form parameter type
Parameter:
