## Future Features

These are the features we're planning on building in the near future:
- Stricter input validation
  - Support for the required field in the Swagger spec
  - At least some of the validation defined in http://swagger.io/specification/#parameterIn. In particular we want to be able to support checking whether an input parameter is a valid object ID.
- More robust server defaults
  - SIGTERM handling
- Better logging, monitoring, and metrics
  - Logger from the Context
  - Expose pprof port by default
  - Automatically log process metrics (https://github.com/Clever/go-process-metrics)
- More server middleware
  - Panic recovery / handling (don't crash the server every time you get a panic)
- More client resiliency best practices
  - Smarter retry logic
  - Timeouts


## Swagger Spec

Currently, this repo doesn't implement the entire Swagger Spec. This is a non-exhaustive list of the parts of the Swagger specification that haven't been implemented yet.

All Mime Types

Patterned Fields (these are vendor specific extensions anyway)

Multi-File Swagger Definitions

Schema:
- host
- tags
- scheme (just http)
- consumes
- produces
- securityDefinitions
- security

Consumes:
- produces
- consumes
- schemes
- security

Form parameter type
Parameter:
- type (array or file)
- collectionFormat
- possibly the json schema requirements? (uniqueItems, multipleOf, etc...)

Schema object (all these have to be defined in /definitions and are generated by go-swagger)

Discriminators

XML Modeling

Security Objects

Response:
  - Headers
